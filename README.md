### Our cryptoprotocol: _Singulum_

```markdown
We use:

1. ECDSA (Meliorated FIPS<sup>[1](#fn_fips)</sup> for digital signatures which uses elliptic curve cryptography) 
2. ECMQV (Authenticated protocol for key agreement based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman scheme which uses elliptic curve cryptography)
3. SHA3 (Keccak hash algorithm)
4. Threefish (Symmetric-key tweakable block cipher)

```

For more details see [our docs](https://waaark.com/error) about Foxon, Singulum and so on.
